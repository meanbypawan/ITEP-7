Q.1 Peak an element

An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbour element 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[] ≤ 106

Q.9 Find the Union and Intersaction of two sorted array.
Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find union between these two arrays. 
Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.
Example 1:
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the
elements which comes in the union set
of both arrays. So count is 5.
Example 2:
Input:
6 2 
85 25 1 32 54 6
85 2 
Output: 
7
Explanation: 
85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, and
2 are the elements which comes in the
union set of both arrays. So count is 7.

0 is one of the element 
in the array so there exist a 
subarray with sum 0.

A[] = {8,3,1,2}
Output: 29
Explanation: Above the configuration
possible by rotating elements are
3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
